## Project Overview
This project involves building a complete data pipeline for FlexiMart, an e-commerce company. It covers the end-to-end process of extracting "dirty" raw CSV data, transforming it for quality, loading it into a Relational Database (MySQL), analyzing NoSQL (MongoDB) requirements for a product catalog, and finally designing a Data Warehouse (Star Schema) for business intelligence.
