# Part 1: Database Design and ETL Pipeline

## Overview
This component handles the ingestion and cleaning of raw e-commerce data. It transforms "dirty" CSV files into a structured relational format and loads them into a MySQL database named `fleximart`.

## ETL Implementation Details

### 1. Extract
- **Sources:** `customers_raw.csv`, `products_raw.csv`, `sales_raw.csv`.
- **Method:** Utilized Python `pandas` for high-performance data reading and initial profiling.

### 2. Transform (Data Cleaning Strategy)
- **Deduplication:** Identified and removed duplicate `customer_id` and `transaction_id` records to ensure primary key integrity.
- **Handling Missing Values:**
    - **Customers:** Dropped records missing critical email addresses.
    - **Products:** Imputed missing prices using the **Mean Price** of their respective categories to maintain financial consistency.
    - **Sales:** Filtered out "orphan" records missing `customer_id` or `product_id`.
- **Standardization:**
    - **Phone Numbers:** Applied Regular Expressions (Regex) to format all numbers to `+91-XXXXXXXXXX`.
    - **Categories:** Unified mixed-case strings (e.g., "electronics" → "Electronics").
    - **Dates:** Converted multiple formats (`DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`) into standard SQL `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### 3. Load
- **Technology:** `SQLAlchemy` and `mysql-connector-python`.
- **Target Schema:** 4-table relational structure (Customers, Products, Orders, Order_Items).

- `etl_pipeline.py`: The main Python script that executes the Extract, Transform, and Load logic.
- `schema_documentation.md`: Detailed description of the 3NF database design and entity relationships.
- `business_queries.sql`: SQL solutions for Customer History, Category Analysis, and Monthly Trends.
- `data_quality_report.txt`: Automated report generated by the script showing record counts and cleaning metrics.

## How to Run
1. Ensure your MySQL server is running.
2. Create the database: `CREATE DATABASE fleximart;`
3. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python etl_pipeline.py
